Notes:
console.dir allows HTML element to be displayed as an object with an interactive list
    console.dir(object);
    vs console.log which displays element's HTML
    console.log(object) | console.log("string", object);

can use console.dir(window.document.querySelector(object)); to pull up interactive list
    since we are opening index.html in browser, writing window is unneeded since
    it is a global object

ex used in lesson:
    console.dir(window.document);

user behavior is called an event (in this case the click)
observation of that event is called the event listener
response to that event is called the event handler

console.log(buttonEl);
    convention: the El indicates this is a DOM element

var counter = 10
var countdown = function () {
    console.log(counter);
    counter--;
    if (counter === 0){
        console.log("blastoff");
        clearInterval(startCountdown);
    };
};

var startCountdown = setInterval(countdown, 1000);

var sayHello = function() {
    console.log("Hello there");
};

var timedGreeting = setTimeout(sayHello, 2000);

clearTimeout(timedGreeting);

<--
why would you want to do clearTimeout? in some cases you might not want the callback
function in setTimeout to occur. this prevents the callback function from occuring.

without this, sayHello will execute after 2 seconds.

what's special about "submit" vs "click" is "submit" listens for two conditions:
1) user clicks button element with type="submit" attribute
2) user presses enter on keyboard

when we use javascript to listen for an event that occurs on an HTML element, browser
    collects all that information and packagest it into a JS object that can be used
    aka Event Interface
this object can be used, aka Event Object, by making the function that's executed by 
    the event have an argument to represent the event object
    the browser can then fill in the data for that event and pass argument into the function

`document.querySelector()` returns the first element it finds on the page

create an eventListener and console log it's event.target
    this allows you to click on an element in the browser and it will console log it's html code
        var pageContentEl = document.querySelector("#page-content");
        var taskButtonHandler = function(event) {
            console.log(event.target);
        };
        pageContentEl.addEventListener("click", taskButtonHandler);

querySelector() vs matches()
    querySelector() returns element
    matches() returns true/false

in the following code:
    var taskSelected = document.querySelector(".task-item[data-task-id='" + taskId + "']");
it is important to note that since there is no space between `.task-item` and `[data-task-id]`
this indicates that the properties are both within the same element
    if there was a space between the two, it would indicate that `[data-task-id]` attribute
    is somewhere inside a `.task-item` element

localStorage() can only save things as a string, and it is difficult to convert DOM elements
to a string. solution should package the data in key:value pairs in an array variable

for deleting a task, we need to create a new variable (updatedTaskArr) to store data.
    we compare the updated tasks's id to the current/previous task's id, and if it is not the
    same (aka new task created) then we want to keep the task and .push() it into
    the new updatedTasksArr. 

when to save data? anytime we make data changes. don't forget to retrieve saved data!

how to clear localStorage from browser:
- open DevTools => Application tab => Clear Storage next to trask can icon
  => clear site data in dialog that appears

  - line 58: taskDataObj.name showing as undefined
  - line 62-77, specifically line 72 showing error of undefined
