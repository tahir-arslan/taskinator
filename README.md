# Taskinator

This javascript lesson is to introduce the concept of the DOM, or Document Object Model and teach it's relationship to HTML. We are taught how to use it's built-in tools to our advantage while coding through projects. The window object is also used in order to teach about and how to use local/session storage. 

DOM API methods are used to select and dynamically generate HTML elements and content and handle events such as key presses/mouse clicks.
